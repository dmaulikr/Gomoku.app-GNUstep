This file documents building (and optionally installing) Gomoku.app on
GNUstep.

REQUIREMENTS
============

First, make sure you have GNUstep installed.  You need at least:

 gnustep-make
 gnustep-base
 gnustep-gui
 gnustep-back (there are different backends available, make sure you
have one of them)

installed on your system, with the corresponding development headers.


COMPILING
=========

Once you have these things, to compile simply type:

  make

That should compile the program and put it into a directory called
'Gomoku.app'.  The standard way of starting the program is then:

  openapp ./Gomoku.app


INSTALLING
==========

Type:

  make install

to install the program.  Once installed, you should be able to run it using

  openapp Gomoku.app


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If the program doesn't seem to compile, double-check your gnustep
installation.  If all seems OK, it may be that you have gnustep, but
it's not setup properly.

Please refer to the gnustep configuration documentation for help.

If you don't want to bother, a quick way of fixing the problem should
be to source the GNUstep configuration script.  The script is called
'GNUstep.sh'.  Find the script on your system (on GNU/Linux normally
it's in /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh or in
/usr/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh), then source it:

. /usr/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

Then, try 'make' again.
